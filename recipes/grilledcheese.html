        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>To make the <em>perfect</em> grilled cheese, start by buttering two slices of your favorite bread
             on one side. Heat a skillet over medium heat and place one slice of bread, butter-side-down,
              onto the pan. Layer on your choice of cheese cheddar is a classic, but you can mix in Swiss,
               mozzarella, or any other cheese that melts well. Top with the second slice of bread, 
               butter-side-up. Cook for about 3-4 minutes on each side, pressing <strong>lightly</strong> with a spatula,
                until the bread is golden brown and the cheese is beautifully melted inside. Keep an eye 
                on the heat to avoid burning the bread before the cheese melts completely. Once done, 
                remove from the pan, slice it up, and enjoy the warm, cheesy goodness!</p>
