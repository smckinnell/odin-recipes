        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Mix warm water and sugar in a small bowl, then add the yeast. Let it sit
                 for about 10 minutes until it’s bubbly.<br> In a big bowl, mix the flour and salt, then add
                  olive oil and the yeast mixture. Stir everything together, then knead the dough<br> for 5-7
                   minutes until it’s smooth. Cover the dough and let it rise for about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: While the dough rises, heat olive oil in a pan, then add the crushed 
                tomatoes, oregano, garlic powder, and salt.<br> Let it cook for about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Assemble the pizza: Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Once the dough has risen, punch it
                 down and roll it out to your preferred<br> size. Place it on a baking sheet. Spread the sauce
                  over the dough, then add the mozzarella cheese and your favorite toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake the Pizza: Bake the Pizza: Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden
                and the cheese is bubbly.</li>
